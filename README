Prerequisites:

Firefox 1.5 - Firefox 3.6 (or IceWeasel)
 (PDF Export requires Firefox 3.0 or later)
 (PNG Export requires Firefox 2.0 or later)
 
The "commandlineprint" extension (http://sites.google.com/site/torisugari/commandlineprint2)
which ships with this software (see /extensions/cmdlnprint_0_5_2.xpi)

Furthermore this software is needed:

- xvfb
- touch (normally exists on every linux system)
- ps2pdf
- imagemagick

Configuration:

1) Start Firefox (on a server you can make this possible with "ssh -X")
2) Shut down Firefox and then edit your prefs.js file 
    (located at ~/.mozilla/firefox/<your_profile>/prefs.js)
3) Add the lines from firefox_config/prefs.js to the prefs.js
4) Start Firefox again and set the default Papersize to Din A3 (landscape orientation)
5) Install the firefox extension commandlineprint (shipped with this package)
6) You're done

Important hints:

For best results please use not the regular MindWeb for the screenshots.
The sub-application MindView is far better for the export.
